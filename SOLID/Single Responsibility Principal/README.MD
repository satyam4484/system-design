# Online Bookstore Management System

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with developing an online bookstore management system. The system should allow users to browse books, add books to their cart, and make purchases. Additionally, administrators should be able to manage inventory, view sales reports, and update book details.

## Design Considerations

When designing the system, adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), ensuring that each class or module has a clear and distinct responsibility. Avoid burdening classes with responsibilities that should be delegated elsewhere.

Consider the following aspects when designing the system:

1. **User Management:** Implement user authentication, registration, and profile management functionalities.

2. **Book Management:** Develop features to add, remove, and update books in the inventory. Implement search and filtering functionalities to facilitate book browsing.

3. **Shopping Cart:** Design a module to manage the user's shopping cart, including adding/removing items and calculating the total price.

4. **Order Processing:** Implement functionalities for users to place orders and for administrators to process and fulfill orders.

5. **Inventory Management:** Develop features for administrators to manage book inventory, including adding new books, updating quantities, and removing books.

6. **Reporting:** Implement reporting functionalities to generate sales reports, bestseller lists, and other relevant statistics.

## Solution Approach

Ensure that each class or module in the system demonstrates a clear separation of concerns and maintainability, allowing for easy modification and extension in the future. Follow best practices for object-oriented design principles and modular architecture.
