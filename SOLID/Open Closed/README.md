# Online Payment Processing System

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with developing an online payment processing system capable of handling various payment methods while ensuring flexibility for future expansion. The system should enable users to make payments using credit/debit cards, PayPal, digital wallets, and other emerging payment technologies. Additionally, administrators should be able to manage payment methods, view transaction reports, and process refunds.

## Design Considerations

When designing the system, adhere to the Open-Closed Principle (OCP), ensuring that the system's behavior can be extended without modifying existing code. Avoid making direct modifications to existing code when adding support for new payment methods.

Consider the following aspects when designing the system:

1. **Payment Method Abstraction:** Implement a payment method interface or abstract class to define the common operations required for processing payments.

2. **Concrete Payment Methods:** Develop separate classes for each payment method, such as CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, and DigitalWalletPayment. Each class should implement the payment method interface and provide specific implementation details.

3. **Payment Processing Module:** Design a payment processing module responsible for handling payment requests and routing them to the appropriate payment method class based on user selection.

4. **Administrator Dashboard:** Create an administrator dashboard to manage payment methods, view transaction logs, and process refunds. Ensure that the dashboard is modular and can accommodate new payment methods seamlessly.

5. **Logging and Reporting:** Implement logging and reporting functionalities to track payment transactions, detect errors, and generate transaction reports for auditing purposes.

## Solution Approach

Ensure that the payment processing system follows the Open-Closed Principle by allowing for the addition of new payment methods without modifying existing code. Utilize inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to achieve modular and extensible design.

## Implementation Details

- **Payment Method Interface:** Define a PaymentMethod interface or abstract class with common methods such as processPayment().

- **Concrete Payment Methods:** Implement concrete payment method classes (e.g., CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment) that inherit from the PaymentMethod interface and provide specific payment processing logic.

- **Payment Processing Module:** Develop a payment processing module responsible for receiving payment requests, identifying the selected payment method, and delegating the payment processing task to the appropriate concrete payment method class.

- **Administrator Dashboard:** Create an administrator dashboard with features for managing payment methods, viewing transaction logs, and processing refunds. Ensure that the dashboard's design allows for easy integration of new payment methods.

- **Logging and Reporting:** Implement logging mechanisms to record payment transactions and errors. Develop reporting functionalities to generate transaction reports for analysis and auditing purposes.

## Conclusion

By adhering to the Open-Closed Principle and implementing a modular and extensible design, the Online Payment Processing System provides a robust solution for handling various payment methods. The system's architecture allows for seamless integration of new payment methods while ensuring maintainability and scalability.
