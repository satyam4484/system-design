# Strategy Design Pattern - Payment System

## Overview

This project demonstrates the **Strategy Design Pattern** applied to a **Payment System**. The Strategy Pattern allows an object to change its behavior at runtime by selecting an appropriate algorithm (or strategy) for a specific task. In this case, we implement different payment methods such as **Credit Card Payment**, **Cash Payment**, and potentially more, with each having its own algorithm for processing payments.

### Problem Statement

We want to build a **PaymentProcessor** system that can process payments in different ways without changing the core payment processing logic. We will define different **payment strategies** (e.g., CreditCardPayment, CashPayment) and select the appropriate strategy at runtime.

### Solution

By using the **Strategy Design Pattern**, we will:
- Define a `PaymentStrategy` interface that all payment strategies will implement.
- Create concrete classes such as `CreditCardPayment`, `CashPayment`, etc., each implementing the `PaymentStrategy` interface with their own logic for processing payments.
- The `PaymentProcessor` class will use a `PaymentStrategy` to process payments, without being concerned with the specific implementation details of each payment method.

## Structure

### Classes:

1. **PaymentStrategy** (Interface):  
   - Abstract class that defines the contract for various payment methods.  
   - Method: `virtual void pay(int amount) = 0;`

2. **CreditCardPayment** (Concrete Strategy):  
   - Implements the `PaymentStrategy` interface for processing credit card payments.
   - Constructor accepts a credit card number.

3. **CashPayment** (Concrete Strategy):  
   - Implements the `PaymentStrategy` interface for processing cash payments.

4. **PaymentProcessor**:  
   - This class uses a `PaymentStrategy` to process the payment. The `PaymentProcessor` class is decoupled from the actual payment method being used.

## How It Works

1. **PaymentStrategy Interface**:  
   This defines the common method `pay(int amount)` that all concrete payment methods must implement.

2. **Concrete Strategies**:  
   - **CreditCardPayment**: Processes payments through a credit card.
   - **CashPayment**: Handles payments made in cash.

3. **PaymentProcessor**:  
   - Takes a `PaymentStrategy` object and delegates the payment processing to the selected strategy.

### Benefits of the Strategy Pattern:
- **Flexibility**: You can add new payment strategies (e.g., PayPal, Bitcoin, etc.) without changing the existing code in the `PaymentProcessor`.
- **Decoupling**: The client code doesnâ€™t need to know about the specific details of each payment method. It only needs to interact with the `PaymentStrategy` interface.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: The system is open for extension (e.g., adding new payment methods), but closed for modification (you donâ€™t need to change existing classes to add new strategies).

## Use Cases

1. **E-commerce websites**: Offering multiple payment options like credit card, cash on delivery, and digital wallets.
2. **Payment Gateways**: Integrating different payment strategies from various providers (PayPal, Stripe, etc.).
3. **Subscription-based services**: Supporting recurring payments through different channels.

## Conclusion

The **Strategy Design Pattern** is perfect for scenarios like this, where an object must decide between different algorithms or strategies based on the context. With this approach, we have a flexible and maintainable payment system, allowing for the addition of new payment methods without affecting existing code.
